			<p>VinFast is a LLC private automotive startup manufacturer headquartered in Vietnam, a member of VinGroup.</p>

			<p>The company was founded in 2017 by Vingroup. The company designed its models with the help of Pininfarina, BMW and Magna Steyr and participated in the 2018 Paris Motor Show. VinFast claims it will be the first volume automotive manufacturer in Vietnam as well as the first Vietnamese automaker to participate in a major international auto show.</p>
